# OSSCAR software
A program to control OSSCAR (Asher et al. 2015), a custom-built, semi-autonomous underway instrument for the measurement of dissolved DMS, DMSO, and DMSP concentrations in seawater. This version is a rewrite of the original software. Major changes includes functionality for DMSO reductase-based analysis being replaced with catalyst-driven, electrochemistry-based analysis of DMSO (McCulloch & Tortell, 2023), revised metadata saving, and modular code design. 

For compatability with PFPD detectors and the DMSO reductase method, the legacy version of this software (originally written by Elizabeth Asher & John Dacey, modified by myself) is included. For further details, see Asher et al. (2015).
